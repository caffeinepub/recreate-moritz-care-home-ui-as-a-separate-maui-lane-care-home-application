# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Replace all user-facing occurrences of the text “Moritz Care Home” with “Maui Lane Care Home” across the frontend UI.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the print-only Resident Profile Report header text to display “Maui Lane Care Home” (ResidentProfilePrintReport).
- Update the references capture page copy so it no longer shows “Moritz Care Home” anywhere visible (MoritzReferenceCapture).
- Run a global search and replace/remove any remaining user-facing occurrences of the exact string “Moritz Care Home” in frontend source text.

**User-visible outcome:** Anywhere the UI previously displayed “Moritz Care Home” (including the resident print report and references page) will now display “Maui Lane Care Home”, with no remaining visible instances of the old name.
