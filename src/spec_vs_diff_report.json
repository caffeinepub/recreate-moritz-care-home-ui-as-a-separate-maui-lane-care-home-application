  "summary": "REQ-46 and REQ-48 appear implemented: version markers updated to 59 in the specified files and a new Version 59 deployment guide was added under frontend/docs with the requested verification checks, commands, and smoke-test checklist. REQ-47 (actual production deployment success on IC) cannot be confirmed/implemented via the provided code diff; the diff only adds documentation/scripts, not evidence of a successful `dfx deploy --network ic` or live endpoint verification. The diff also includes substantial unrelated frontend feature/UI changes beyond a version-promotion scope.",

      "id": "REQ-47",
      "requirement": "Deploy Version 59 to the Internet Computer production network so the live canisters serve the Version 59 build.",
