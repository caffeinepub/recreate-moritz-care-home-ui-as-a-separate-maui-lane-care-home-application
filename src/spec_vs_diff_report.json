  "summary": "Frontend version markers were updated to 58 and a new Version 58 deployment guide was added. However, the diff also includes unrelated modifications (not explicitly requested) to backend code and project metadata, and it cannot demonstrate that an actual IC mainnet deployment and post-deploy smoke checks were performed.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-44",
      "requirement": "Deploy Version 58 to the Internet Computer production network so the live canisters serve the Version 58 build (including executing `dfx deploy --network ic` and completing post-deploy smoke checks).",
      "reason": "The diff only shows code/documentation changes; it does not provide evidence of an executed production deployment or results of required smoke checks on the live site.",

      "description": "Backend canister code changes in `backend/main.mo` (new/expanded type definitions and imports shown) that are not requested by the BuildRequest, which focuses on version markers and deployment/docs.",

    {
      "description": "Updates/additions to repository metadata/state files not requested for the Version 58 publish (e.g., `project_state.json`).",
