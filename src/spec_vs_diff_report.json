  "summary": "The diff updates branding configuration (BRAND.logo.path) and updates frontend/index.html to reference new favicon and apple-touch-icon assets under /assets/generated. However, the required generated image files are not added in this diff, and the 192x192 app icon link is not present in index.html. Evidence is insufficient to confirm that all in-app logo renders (login/header) now display the new logo beyond the brand config change.",
