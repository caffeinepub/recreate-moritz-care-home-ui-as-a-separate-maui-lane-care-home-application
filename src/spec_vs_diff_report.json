  "summary": "Diff updates branding config to point logoPath to assets/generated/MauiLaneCareHome-4.jpg, but does not add the requested JPG asset file and provides no direct evidence of login/header rendering behavior changes beyond the shared brand config.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-20",
      "requirement": "Add the uploaded image file \"MauiLaneCareHome-4.jpg\" under frontend/public/assets/generated/ so it is served reliably in IC deployments.",
      "reason": "The diff shows no added files; therefore the required static asset file is not present in the changes, and runtime accessibility (BASE_URL-prefixed) cannot be satisfied from this diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "<file-diff>: ADDED FILES: none"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "REQ-22",
      "requirement": "Ensure the login/sign-in screen (ProtectedGate) and authenticated header (MauiAppShell) display the uploaded logo via the existing BrandLogo component, without sizing/fallback regressions.",
      "reason": "The diff does not include modifications to ProtectedGate or MauiAppShell, and only shows a change to frontend/src/lib/brand.ts. From the diff alone, there is no direct evidence that both screens use BrandLogo in the intended way and that sizing/fallback behavior is preserved.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/lib/brand.ts",
        "frontend-file-summaries.txt (shows ProtectedGate.tsx and MauiAppShell.tsx descriptions but no code diff confirming behavior)"
